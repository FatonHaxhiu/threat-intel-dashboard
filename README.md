## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Python 3.11**: Backend scripting and dashboard
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV handling
- **Requests**: HTTP requests for fetching threat intel feeds
- **Streamlit**: Dashboard frontend for visualization and search
- **dotenv**: Secure management of API keys and configuration

## üöÄ Purpose of the Project

The Threat Intel Dashboard is an open-source tool to help security analysts and IT teams easily aggregate, visualize, and search threat intelligence data from multiple sources. By collecting indicators of compromise (IOCs) such as suspicious IP addresses from feeds like AlienVault OTX and AbuseIPDB, the dashboard enables rapid situational awareness, threat hunting, and actionable security response.

**Key Features:**
- Fetches and aggregates threat IP addresses from multiple feeds
- Presents summary stats, visualizations, and a searchable interface
- Allows lookup of specific IPs to check if they appear in threat feeds
- Supports exporting of current threat lists for further use (e.g., in firewalls)
- Built for extensibility‚Äîadd new feeds or enrichments easily!

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How to Use

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/threat-intel-dashboard.git
cd threat-intel-dashboard
```

### 2. **Set Up API Keys**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```
ALIENVAULT_API_KEY=your_otx_key_here
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=your_abuseipdb_key_here
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Fetch Threat Feed Data**

Run the backend fetcher script to download and process the latest data:

```bash
python3 backend/fetch_feeds.py
```

You should see output about how many IPs were saved from each feed. If you hit a rate limit, wait until your quota resets.

### 5. **Run the Dashboard**

Start the Streamlit dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

This will open your default browser to the dashboard interface (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

### 6. **Explore and Search**

- View summary stats and visualizations on the main page
- Use the search box to look up specific IPs
- Browse the full table of threat IPs
- Download the combined IP list as CSV

## üß© Extending the Project

- Add new threat feeds by creating new functions in `backend/fetch_feeds.py`
- Add enrichments (ASN, geo, etc.) using APIs like ipinfo.io or ip-api.com
- Improve frontend visualizations or add new search/filter features
